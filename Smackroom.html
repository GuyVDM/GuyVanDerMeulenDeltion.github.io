						<h2>Concept:</h2>
						</header>
						<p>This is Project-SmackRoom, a <b>VR Online Multiplayer Dungeon Crawler</b> that is set in Hollywood, the game it's overall theme is cartoony with the enemies having a chibi look to them. The goal of this game is to progress throughout the level, and to do that you need to kill every single enemy with a weapon of your choice.
							For this assignment I have a timespan of <b>8 weeks</b>, and to this day it is still being worked on. This project has also been one of my first real projects that I have been using <b>Photon</b> with. and to combine it with <b>VR</b> has proven to be a real challenge so far, but also the most fun!</p>

						<h2>What I have done:</h2>
						<p>I had the role of <b>Lead Developer</b>. The following tasks is where I did the majority/all of the work.</p>
						<p>- Networking / Player Instance<br>
						- Data Syncing<br>
						- Enemy Behaviour and partial implementation<br>
						- UI with Animations + Functionality<br>
						- Implementation 50%<br>
						- Movement<br>
						- Weapon Behaviour 90%
						<h2>Challenges:</h2>
						<p>This game has proven to be the most difficult project that i've done by far, with the reason being that <b>VR + Networking</b> is a combinations of workflows that i have not yet used up until this project.
						The data syncing together with the interactions of several objects and detecting which player should perform what event on who's screen has been a big mind boggle. But the longer I have been working on it, the more efficient and understandable the workflow has gotten.</p>

						<br>
						<p>One of the very first difficulties I have encountered in this project thus far has been the <b>Enemies</b>. This is with the reason that the enemies ragdoll and everything that happens on the main screen, should <b>almost perfectly</b>
							be copied on the rest of the screens without jittering to make it feel clean, but with the limitations of how much data we can synchronize at once, this has proven to be a huge struggle, and has taken a chunk of time to find a viable fix for it.
							After that I started working on a <b>EnemyManager</b> that would handle every instance of an enemy in a server over the network, so that it's behaviour would be <b>perfectly synchronized</b> across all the clients that had joined the host it's server.
