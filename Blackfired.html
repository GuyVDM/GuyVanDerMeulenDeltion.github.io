						<h2>Concept:</h2>
						</header>
						<p>This is Project-Blackfired, it's an <b>VR Escape Room</b> based in an Office setting. The game is about a character who is an ex-employee from a tech company, the story follows as the character has been fired for unfair reasons by his boss, the player finds his way back into the office one day to steal some important documents to blackmail his ex-employer, but little did they know that it was a honeypod all along, and thus the player quickly needs to find a way to escape the building.</p>

						<h2>What I have done:</h2>

						<p>In this project I had the role of <b>Lead Developer</b>, this whole project was a big <b>Learning Curve</b>, since it was my first VR project.</p>
						<p>- Player Controller <br>
						- Puzzles<br>
						- Interaction<br>
						- Teleporting<br>
						- Object & UI + Animations<br>
						- Implementation<br>
						- Audio<br>
						- Tutorial<br>
						- Ray Interaction</p>

						<h2>Challenges:</h2>
						<p>Since this was my first ever look at how VR Development works, it took alot of trial and error to figure out the best ways to handle specific things, as it was quite a different stream to follow. There were several things that took some time to make as, example, interactables such as <b>doors and drawers</b>.
							Basically what I have done for this approach was one big inheritance tree for objects that could be interacted with. In this case I made the template class with several <b>Virtual functions</b>, for the reason that every object you could interact with, would have different functionality, but needed to have the same function called. After the logic behind the approach was clear, the development speed increased. In the end, we had an estimate of <b>8 weeks</b> to complete this assignment.
