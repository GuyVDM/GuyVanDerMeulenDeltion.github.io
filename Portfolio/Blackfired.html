		<p class= "text">This is <b>"Project Blackfired"</b> and has been my first look into VR development, in this project i had the role of <b>Lead Developer</b>.</p>
		<p class= "text">This project is a <b>VR Escape Room project</b>, with this projects goal to explore throughout the level, do puzzles, progress, and reach the end as fast as possible.</p>
		<p class= "text">Ofcourse at the start of such a project where you have no insight about what to do you start to look into the basics,</p>
		<p class= "text">and i quickly found out that the best approach to a workflow was to build things that were very modulair and easy to use.</p>
		<p class= "text">But luckily enough for me, was the fact that VR development and the approach that was needed wasn't very alien to me.</p>
		<class= "imageBorder"><img src="images/Snippet_Blackfired_001.jpg" class="imageBorder"</p>
		<p class= "text">So what i did first was what and how the player can interact with an object. I decided to create an base <b>Abstract Class</b> that would have</p>
		<p class= "text">one base function <b>"Interact"</b>, and that would always be activated once a player grabbed/interacted with an interactable,</p>
		<p class= "text">and would handle whatever what was in the function.</p>

		<!-- article 3 -->
		<p class= "text">Even though our game was supposed to be small and compact, we still wanted to make sure that even new players got a hint of where to go.</p>
		<p class= "text">This came up to be the next challenge, and after a while of brainstorming of how & what, i decided to create a <b>region loading system</b>.</p>
		<p class= "text">This system would have a function that'd make it so that when the player progressed throughout the level, another region would be loaded,</p>
		<p class= "text">and the other regions would unload, this was made with the reason so that the player would experience minimal backtracking.</p>
		<class= "imageBorder"><img src="images/Snippet_Blackfired_002.jpg" class="imageBorder"</p>
		<p class= "text">If the player were to attempt to backtrack, he would be faced with a fading black screen when he goes out of bounds,</p>
		<p class= "text">and with the attempt of the player teleporting into a room where he has not yet progress to, he's met with the fact that he cannot go there.</p>
