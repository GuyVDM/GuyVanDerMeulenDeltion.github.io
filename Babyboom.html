						<h2>Concept:</h2>
						</header>
						<p>The concept of this game is one that's about a baby, that lives in a world made out of candy, in this world there is a tale about this mysterious object called <b>The Golden Rattle</b>. The world is full of inhabitants that are babies, which often will require help from the player to complete diverse tasks and quests which are the main progression of the game. The whole map is also covered with diverse candies which can be collected as a currency to unlock diverse Cosmetics or Abilities. The whole world is divided in multiple pieces that are ready to be roamed and explored. We had a timespan of roughly <b>7 weeks</b> to complete this game.</p>

						<h2>What I have done:</h2>
						<p>Since I had the role of <b>Lead Developer</b>, there were plenty tasks for me to do. The following tasks is where I did the majority/all of the work.</p>
						<p>- Player Controller <br>
						- Cutscenes<br>
						- Modular Quest System (Done with teammate)<br>
						- Audio<br>
						- Object & UI + Animations<br>
						- Implementation<br>
						- Checkpoint System<br>
						- Dialogue System</p>
						<h2>Challenges:</h2>
						<p>This game it's overall concept was pretty big for the time we had gotten for it, so the mechanics like creating a Cutscene, Dialogue and Quest system needed to be thought through to get them implemented into the game as soon as possible. Since we wanted multiple quests into the game real quick we decided to try and make it as modular as possible.</p>

						<br>
						<p>Making this was probably the easiest to make, but took the longest time, hence the difficulty of working it out, this is with the reason that I had grand ideas in our head to make such a system, but I quickly figured a lot of the approaches i intended to make would take a lot of Development-Time out of our hands, so we quickly thought of something else.
							What we eventually ended up making was a reasonably small quest system, that would revolve around the concept of <b>Collectables</b>, basically what we've done was storing a integer, this integer would represent the amount of collectables you need to finish the quest, the way this made it so modular was the fact that we could use diverse actions to up the integer, so that the quest could be completed in diverse manners.
							So, for example, we could make it so that the player needed to collect a few items, or that he would need to perform diverse sorts of actions to up the integer, so that it eventually got to the point where the player did enough to finish off the quest. This was by far one of the easiest approaches we could take at that moment due to <b>time constraints</b>.
